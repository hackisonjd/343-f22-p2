    <p>This app is designed with heavy inspiration from a weather station I had growing up, the <a href="https://www.bushnelloptics.com/bushnell-weather-instruments-weatherfx.html">Bushnell Wireless FX 5</a>. It is designed to show the weather given a location check.</p>
    <p>The app connects to two APIs, the <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs">Weather Forecast API</a> provided by Open-Meteo, and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation API</a> present in many browsers natively.</p>
    <p>This app satisfies the requirements of the assignment because it is responsive, uses two different APIs, and displays results to a query.</p>
